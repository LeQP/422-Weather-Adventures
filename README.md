# 422-Weather Adventures

# Description
This system is intended to assist in the planning and execution of outdoor recreation activities in the Oregon area. Upon application startup, a map is displayed with several overlay options. The map can show wind direction or weather status symbols. Multiple view zoom levels can be selected: Eugene, Lane County, and Oregon state. The user can click a map grid square to bring up a secondary window with additional information. This information includes detailed weather description and recommended outdoor activities based on weather status and distance from the selected grid square.

# Project Motivation
The community of Oregon outdoor activity enthusiasts will benefit from the use of this system. Our system's creation was motivated by a lack of cohesion in outdoor information services. In the state of the application space, there was no single service that delivered both weather data and outdoor activiy guides. As a solution, our system uses up-to-date weather information to generate lists of activities suitable for the current conditions. The user no longer needs to cross-reference weather data and guides from different sources.
